    // 1. Set up a blank HTML document with the appropriate links to your JavaScript and CSS files.
    
    // 2. Write the functions that hit the API. You’re going to want functions that can take a location and return the weather data for that location. 
    // For now, just console.log() the information.
    
    // 3. Write the functions that process the JSON data you’re getting from the API and return an object with only the data you require for your app.
    // Set up a simple form that will let users input their location and will fetch the weather info (still just console.log() it).
    
    // 4. Display the information on your webpage!
    
    5. Add any styling you like!
    
    6. Optional: add a ‘loading’ component that displays from the time the form is submitted until the information comes back from the API.
    
    7. Push that baby to github and share your solution below!
